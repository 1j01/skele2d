# Skele2D

Skele2D is a game engine based around points, with a fancy in-game editor.

This project is pre-alpha. Consider it unreleased.

## Features

* Animation & pose system lets you manipulate and compose poses and animations any way you want,
with tweening/interpolation helpers for cyclical and linear animations
* In-game editor where you can easily place and manipulate entities
* Pretty looking and professional UI
* Entity previews and previews of animations and animation frames, shown with *your* arbitrary drawing code
* You can select entities, drag them around, pose them, cut, copy and paste, undo and redo
* Both keyboard shortcuts *and* context menus!
* Arbitrary data can be associated with / tacked onto points, for use with rendering, physics or whatever, for instance "color", "size", "velocity" - you name it!

## Roadmap

* Finish separating this out into a reusable library / framework (from [Tiamblia](https://github.com/1j01/tiamblia-game))
	* Find a good boundary between the engine and game, and think about how to minimize assumptions and "frameworkiness"
		 * Try to remove the proscribed `Entity` class (currently relied upon: `x`, `y`, `structure`, and serialization)
		 * Look into [ResurrectJS](https://github.com/skeeto/resurrect-js) for serialization (I'd come across [cereal](https://github.com/atomizejs/cereal) before, but it doesn't handle prototypes); let's see... there's also [kaiser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/kaiser), and a few others
	* Get rid of [ReactScript](https://github.com/1j01/react-script) (an old library I made which is obsolete)
	* Update all used libraries

* Add <kbd>shift</kbd>/<kbd>ctrl</kbd> selection-manipulation modifiers

* Add <kbd>alt</kbd>+drag to drag the selection from anywhere (i.e. without having to have your mouse over part of the selection, especially for when the selection is a set of points) (inspired by [this video](https://youtu.be/elws59R9CrM))

* Add undo/redo, frame reordering, and maybe variable delays to the animation editor

* Make undo/redo efficient (currently it saves the entire world state every operation!)

* Use this in a few different games

## Demo

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you don't have it.
* [Clone this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
* In a command prompt / terminal, in the project directory, run `npm install && npm run install-example`
* Then to run the demo, from now on you can just do `npm run example`
